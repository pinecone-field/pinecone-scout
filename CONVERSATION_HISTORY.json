If they're receptive to the promotion discussion, you can mention that you'd like to discuss compensation as part of the role change.

It has a slim, flush mount design and comes with a customizable bezel. Picture quality is solid too - QLED technology. It's definitely the premium option for people who care about aesthetics."
